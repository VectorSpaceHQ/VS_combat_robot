This is a controller designed for use in combat robotics. It's inspired by the work of Team Panic (https://www.instructables.com/id/Cheap-Arduino-Combat-Robot-Control/), and developed after building and using 12 of their PCBs.

Below are the changes
- Added on/off switch
- Two joysticks, as one is difficult to mix and control. They're also extremely cheap.
- Joysticks connect to female headers rather than being soldered directly. Easily replacable and easier to install.
- Uses a 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini instead of 5V
- Voltage regulator goes directly to VCC and VCC ties to NRF24. This allows powering both components through the USB programmer, no longer requiring a battery to be plugged in for testing.
- Added an LED for active communications indication
- Weapon is now an on/off switch
