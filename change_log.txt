== Changes from VS v1 to v2 boards ==
* Add better silkscreen guidance on receiver for the NRF24 board and for output pins.

== Changes from Team Panic to VS v1 board ==
* Added on/off switch
* Two joysticks, as one is difficult to mix and control. They're also extremely cheap.
* Joysticks connect to female headers rather than being soldered directly. Easily replacable and easier to install.
* Uses a 3.3V Arduino Pro Mini instead of 5V, making the Arduino the only necessary voltage regulator.
* Voltage regulator goes directly to VCC and VCC ties to NRF24. This allows powering both components through the USB programmer, no longer requiring a battery to be plugged in for testing.
* Added an LED for active communications indication
* Weapon is now an on/off switch
* Receiver has pads for the motor control signals
